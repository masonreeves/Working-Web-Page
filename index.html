  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>I am 18 years old from Gary, Indiana. I grew up playing basketball and now play collegeiate golf. I have 2 cats and
    4 members of my family. I <strong>love</strong> being outside and <em>especially</em> when playing golf. My favorite
    golf course I've ever played is Purgatory in Fishers, Indiana. My favorite golf hole is #7 at Harbor Shores in
    Michigan, which from the green is possibly the most beautiful view in the midwest.</p>

  <h2>Career Goals</h2>
  <p>After school, I would love to be able to move west and work in a tech startup as a software engineer. I'm big on
    alone time while also working as a team, so ideally I would be remote. While it is good<br> money, I know the job
    will be extremely stressful.</p>

  <h3>Top places I want to move after college</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Denver, Colorado</li>
    <li>San Francisco, California</li>
    <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
  </ol>
